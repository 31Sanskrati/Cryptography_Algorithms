### Overview of the OTP Algorithm:

OTP (One-Time Pad) is a symmetric key encryption algorithm that provides perfect secrecy, meaning that it is impossible to decrypt the ciphertext without knowing the key. It requires a random key that is at least as long as the message and is used only once. It uses the XOR operation to combine the plaintext and the key.

### How the OTP Algorithm Works:

1. **Key Generation**: The user provides a random key that is at least as long as the message. The key can be any sequence of bits or characters, as long as it is truly random and never reused.

2. **Encryption**: The plaintext is converted into a binary representation and then XORed with the key bit by bit. The result is the ciphertext, which is also a binary sequence.

3. **Decryption**: The ciphertext is XORed with the same key bit by bit. The result is the original plaintext, which is converted back into the original representation.

### How the Code Works:

1. **File Handling**: The code includes a function for reading and writing files. The plaintext and the key are read from `plaintext.txt` and `key.txt` respectively. The ciphertext and the decrypted text are written to `encrypt.txt` and `decrypt.txt` respectively.

2. **Encryption Function**: The code includes a function for encrypting the plaintext with the key. The plaintext and the key are converted from hexadecimal to binary using the `base64` module. The plaintext and the key are then XORed byte by byte using the `ord` and `chr` functions. The ciphertext is converted from binary to hexadecimal using the `base64` module and returned.

3. **Decryption Function**: The code includes a function for decrypting the ciphertext with the key. The ciphertext and the key are converted from hexadecimal to binary using the `base64` module. The ciphertext and the key are then XORed byte by byte using the `ord` and `chr` functions. The plaintext is converted from binary to hexadecimal using the `base64` module and returned.

4. **Encryption Process**: The code calls the encryption function with the plaintext and the key as input. The ciphertext is then printed and written to `encrypt.txt`.

5. **Decryption Process**: The code calls the decryption function with the ciphertext and the key as input. The plaintext is then printed and written to `decrypt.txt`.
