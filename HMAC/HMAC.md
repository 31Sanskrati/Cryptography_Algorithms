### Overview of HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code):

HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) is a mechanism for generating a cryptographic hash of a message in combination with a secret key. It provides a way to verify both the integrity and authenticity of a message by creating a hash value that is unique to both the message and the key.

### How the HMAC Algorithm Works:

1. **Keyed Hashing**: HMAC combines a hashing algorithm (such as MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256) with a secret key. It applies the hash function to the concatenation of the key and the message, rather than just the message alone. This ensures that even if the same message is hashed multiple times, different results will be obtained when different keys are used.

2. **Padding and XOR Operations**: HMAC involves two stages of processing. First, it XORs each byte of the secret key with a constant value derived from the HMAC specification. Then, it pads the result to ensure a fixed-length input to the hash function.

3. **Iterative Hashing**: After preparing the input, HMAC applies the chosen hash function iteratively to generate the final hash value. Each iteration involves hashing a block of data and updating the hash state using the output of the previous iteration. The final hash value is obtained after processing all blocks.

### How the Code Works:

1. **Initialization**: The code initializes the constants `ipad` and `opad`, which are used for XOR operations with the key. It also sets a constant Initialization Vector (IV).

2. **Key Preparation**: The provided key is converted from hexadecimal to binary and padded to ensure it has a length of 64 bits.

3. **Message Processing**: The message is divided into blocks of 64 bits each. For each block:
   - The block is padded if necessary.
   - The XOR operation is performed between the key and `ipad`.
   - The first hash function is applied to the result of the XOR operation and the IV.
   - The resulting hash value is updated and printed.

4. **Finalization**: After processing all message blocks, another hash function is applied to the result of XOR operation between the key and `opad`, along with the IV. This generates a second hash value.

5. **Tag Generation**: The final HMAC tag is produced by applying the hash function to the result of the first hash operation (using the message blocks) and the second hash value obtained in the finalization step.

6. **Output**: The generated tag is printed as the output of the HMAC function.
