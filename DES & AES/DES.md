### Overview of the DES Algorithm (Data Encryption Standard):

DES (Data Encryption Standard) is a symmetric key encryption algorithm that was widely used for securing electronic data. It operates on blocks of data with a fixed size of 64 bits and uses a 56-bit key for encryption and decryption. The algorithm consists of multiple rounds of permutation, substitution, and transposition.

### How the DES Algorithm Works:

1. **Key Generation**: The 56-bit key provided by the user is used to generate 16 round keys, each of which is 48 bits long. These round keys are derived from the original key through a series of permutations and shifts.

2. **Initial Permutation (IP)**: The input plaintext block undergoes an initial permutation according to a fixed permutation table.

3. **Feistel Network**: The core of the DES algorithm is a Feistel network, which involves splitting the 64-bit block into two 32-bit halves. One half undergoes a series of substitutions and permutations, while the other half is XORed with the output of these operations. This process is repeated for multiple rounds (16 rounds in DES), each using a different round key.

4. **Final Permutation (FP)**: After all the rounds, the two halves are swapped and combined, followed by a final permutation to produce the ciphertext.

### How the Code Works:

1. **Helper Functions**: The code includes several helper functions for converting between hexadecimal, binary, and decimal representations, as well as for performing permutations, shifting bits, and XOR operations.

2. **Key Generation**: The provided key is converted from hexadecimal to binary and then undergoes various permutations and shifts to generate the round keys.

3. **Encryption Function**: The `encrypt` function takes the plaintext and round keys as input. It performs the initial permutation, splits the plaintext into left and right halves, and then iterates through the Feistel rounds. Each round involves expanding, permuting, and substituting the right half, XORing it with the left half, and swapping the halves. Finally, the ciphertext is produced by combining the left and right halves and applying the final permutation.

4. **File Handling**: The code includes functions for reading the key from a file and writing the ciphertext to a file.

5. **Encryption Process**: The plaintext is encrypted using the `encrypt` function with the generated round keys. The ciphertext is then printed.

6. **Decryption Process**: To decrypt the ciphertext, the round keys are reversed, and the `encrypt` function is called again. The resulting plaintext is printed.
